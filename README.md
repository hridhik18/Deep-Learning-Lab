The following is a collection of all experiments covered in the Deep Learning Lab - 

## EXPERIMENTS

### Experiment 1: MNIST using NumPy
**AIM** :  To implement a neural network to classify the MNIST dataset using only NumPy, focusing on the fundamentals of training a neural network without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### Experiment 2: Analyze Non-Linear Dataset using scikit-learn
**AIM**: To analyze and model a non-linear dataset using the scikit-learn library. <br>
It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying various machine learning models to solve the classification problem.

### Experiment 3: CNN Implementation
**AIM** : To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to classify images. <br>
The goal is to understand the inner workings of a CNN, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, using a dataset such as MNIST or CIFAR-10. We focus on the architecture design, training process, and evaluation of the model's performance.
