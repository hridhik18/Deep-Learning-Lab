# MNIST Classification Using NumPy

In this experiment, we implemented a neural network from scratch using only NumPy to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal was to build a fundamental understanding of training a neural network without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Results and Observations  

- The model was able to **successfully classify MNIST digits** after training.  
- Training accuracy improved over epochs, and validation accuracy showed **decent generalization**.

## Conclusion  

This experiment provided valuable insights into how **neural networks work under the hood**. By implementing a basic **feedforward neural network** with **manual backpropagation**, we gained a deeper understanding of **gradient descent, activation functions, and loss optimization**.
